Estelle Berger is a second year Clinical and Developmental Psychology PhD student at the University of Oregon.  She graduated from Brown University in 2016 with a BA in Urban Studies with a particular concentration in education and affordable housing policy. She then completed the Postbaccalaureate Program in Psychology at University of California, Berkeley in 2019. While there, she was a research assistant in the Language and Cognitive Development Lab, and lab manager for the Adolescent Research Collaborative (ARC). With ARC, she worked on a large-scale intervention and research initiative with a network of schools in Peru and Mexico. Broadly, her research focuses on the ways in which larger contextual factors—like home environment, culture, and neighborhood—interact with social behavior, and how that all relates to brain development and adolescent mental health. Her clinical focus centers on working with adolescents, emerging adults, and families.
